#Merges 
```{r}

merged <- merged %>% drop_na() # drop NA values

#Gets delayed/non-delayed flights
```{r}
delayFlights <- merged %>%

nonDelayFlights <- merged %>%

```


#EDA with Delayed/non-delayed Flights
```{r}
mean(delayFlights$visib)
mean(nonDelayFlights$visib)
```

```{r}
merged <- merged %>%
  mutate(delay = as.character(delay)) %>%
  mutate(delay = case_when(
    delay == "TRUE" ~ 1,
    delay == "Early" ~ -1,
    delay == "FALSE" ~ 0,

view(merged)
```

```{r}
modelWeather <- glm(delay ~ temp + dewp + humid + wind_dir + wind_speed + wind_gust + precip + pressure + visib, data = merged)
summary(modelWeather)
```
We find that precip has a p value of 0.667210 which is greater than our alpha value of .05 so we would say that precipitation does not have a noticeable effect on delayed flights in the origin airport.
We find that wind speed has a p value of 0.490046 which is greater than our alpha value of .05 so we would say that precipitation does not have a noticeable effect on delayed flights in the origin airport.
